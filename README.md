# Paint
Vector Based Drawing Application that you can paint alot of different shapes and the implementaion use inheritance,
subclasses and polymorphism to make the code more clear and this was my first oop project  
this project also includes some other featues like save and load using XML and JSON files and the more powerful thing is that you can add other shapes that have the same interface in the runtime
